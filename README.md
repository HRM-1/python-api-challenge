This project involved the analysis of two distinct datasets. The first dataset utilized an API connection to OpenWeatherMap to extract various characteristics of cities. Among the factors studied, our analysis focused on exploring the relationship between latitude and key meteorological variables, including humidity, temperature, cloudiness, and wind speed. To quantify these relationships, we conducted linear regressions and calculated correlation coefficients, enabling us to understand the connections between each pair of variables and how they vary with latitude.

The second dataset involved an API connection to Geoapify, which allowed us to obtain information about hotels located near the cities from the previous dataset. Subsequently, we successfully visualized this hotel information on maps, providing a geographical perspective to the dataset.

Overall, this project combined data extraction, analysis, and visualization to gain insights into how meteorological conditions and hotel availability are distributed across different cities, shedding light on geographical trends and relationships within the datasets.
